# Lively-Spotify-Wallpaper
If you like "Extra" customization like me, i've created this wallpaper to go along with something like rainmeter or even a stock desktop look

First you need some libraries: 
  `pip install spotipy flask flask-cors`

To get the App working you'll need to get a spotify dev account through here: https://developer.spotify.com/ .
get your client-ID and secret-key and add them to the auth.py script.

and you're basically good to go
add the index.html to Lively using the `+` button and run `the run_serv.bat` file.
enjoy ‚ù§ .

also if you don't like the font you can just add your desired font in the fonts folder and change the path in the `styles.css` script
